## Project-Specific Notes

### Internationalization
- **Default locale:** Greek (el)
- **URL structure:** All routes prefixed with locale (e.g., `/el/products`, `/en/products`)
- **Translation files:** `messages/en.json` and `messages/el.json`
- **Switching locale:** Preserves current path using `router.replace(pathname, { locale })`

### Theme System
- **Primary colors:** Teal (#03A7AA) and Red (#FC5855)
- **Color swapping:** Primary/secondary swap between light/dark modes
- **OKLCH color space:** For better color control
- **Greek typography:** Special classes for proper letter-spacing

### Video Handling
- Videos support light/dark theme variants
- Use `data/videos.ts` for theme-aware video sources
- Videos located in `public/videos/dark/` and `public/videos/light/`

## Accessibility

This project prioritizes accessibility:
- Keyboard navigation support throughout
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Reduced motion support via `motion-reduce:` Tailwind classes
- Color-blind friendly (icons + color for status indicators)
- Touch targets meet WCAG 2.5.5 (44x44px minimum)

**Current Score:** 95/100 (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
