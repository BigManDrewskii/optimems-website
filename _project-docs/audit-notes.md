# Audit Notes

## Initial Observations from Greek Homepage (/el)
1. Page loads and renders Greek content correctly
2. Warranty section shows ENGLISH text ("Continuous software updates", "DSO compliance updates", "Email technical support", "Hardware replacement coverage") on the GREEK page - **LOCALIZATION BUG**
3. Need to check theme toggle functionality
4. Need to check English page for similar issues
