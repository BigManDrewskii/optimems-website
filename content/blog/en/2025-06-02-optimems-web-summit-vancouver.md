We're back from an electrifying week at **Web Summit Vancouver** — and we're still buzzing with energy.

## A Global Stage

Optimems had the honor of joining the world's largest startup event, showcasing our groundbreaking energy management solutions at Booth A620 and competing in the prestigious **PITCH** startup competition.

**Out of 1,100 global startups, Optimems reached the Top 10** — the only non-North American company in the finals.

Our CEO, **Angelina Bintoudi**, delivered a powerful presentation that secured us a place in the semifinals, putting the spotlight on our mission to help businesses take control of their energy future.

## Representing Greek Innovation

This milestone reflects the relentless dedication of our team and the global relevance of our work. We're proud to represent the bold, fast-growing Greek tech ecosystem on such a world stage.

A heartfelt thank you to **ΕΒΕΑ – ACCI**, **Enterprise Greece**, and our supporters in the official Greek delegation. And hats off to our fellow Greek startups who made waves at Web Summit — proof that Greek innovation is thriving.

## Looking Ahead

As we scale to international markets, we remain committed to powering up innovation, forging meaningful partnerships, and revolutionizing the way energy assets are managed.

Onwards and upwards.
