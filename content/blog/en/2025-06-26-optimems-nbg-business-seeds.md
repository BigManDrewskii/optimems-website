We're thrilled to announce a major milestone in our journey: **Optimems has been ranked the #1 startup in Greece** at the **15th Innovation & Technology Competition** by NBG Business Seeds and the National Bank of Greece.

## A National Recognition

Selected from over **400 outstanding participants**, this top distinction is a powerful validation of our mission — to accelerate the energy transition through intelligent, scalable solutions like Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).

This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the belief and support of the NBG team, the competition judges, and everyone who's stood behind our vision of a more sustainable energy landscape. We're deeply grateful.

## Why It Matters

The Innovation & Technology Competition is one of Greece's most respected platforms for showcasing visionary startups. Being recognized at the very top means more than just a title — it confirms that the work we're doing is relevant, impactful, and vital for the future of energy.

> "This recognition recharges our motivation to lead the transformation toward a more efficient, resilient, and climate-conscious energy system."

Over the past year, we've pushed boundaries in **energy asset optimization**, empowered businesses to take control of their consumption, and expanded our reach across borders. And this award is a moment to reflect on how far we've come — and how much further we're determined to go.

## What's Next

We're more committed than ever to scaling our solutions, growing our partnerships, and delivering green innovation that works in the real world.

Thank you for believing in us. Let's build the future of energy — together.

— The Optimems Team
