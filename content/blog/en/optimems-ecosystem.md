Optimems is implementing a project titled **Optimems Ecosystem – Development of an Integrated Control and Management Platform for Microgrid and Virtual Power Plant Energy Resources (VPP)**, aiming to create a modern, flexible, and technologically advanced solution for holistic energy resource management.

---

## What is Optimems Ecosystem

Optimems Ecosystem is an integrated energy resource management platform that, through innovative prediction and optimization algorithms, delivers multiple economic and operational benefits to end users. The platform supports efficient operation of microgrids and virtual power plants, enabling optimal utilization of both generated and consumed energy.

---

## Experimental Validation

During the project's development over the past year, the proper functioning of the subsystems has been experimentally validated. Specifically, the following have been successfully tested:

- The generation and consumption energy prediction engines
- The central optimization engine

These form the core of the platform's functionality. The results confirm prediction accuracy and the system's ability to make decisions that maximize economic performance and operational stability.

---

## Interoperability

Concurrently, successful interoperability tests have been conducted with major inverter manufacturers, ensuring that the Optimems platform can seamlessly integrate with the vast majority of inverters available in the market today.

This approach enhances the **vendor-agnostic** nature of the solution and enables wide application across different energy environments and infrastructures.

---

## Purpose and Vision

Optimems Ecosystem addresses the modern challenges of energy transition, offering a comprehensive tool for:

- Managing decentralized energy resources
- Participating in energy markets
- Supporting flexibility and grid balancing services

Thus, it contributes substantially to creating more efficient, sustainable, and resilient energy systems.

---

## Funding

The project is implemented under the **National Recovery and Resilience Plan "Greece 2.0"** with funding from the **European Union – NextGenerationEU**, with a total budget of **€400,000**.

---

## What's Next

With successful validation behind us, Optimems Ecosystem is ready to scale. Our platform has demonstrated its effectiveness in optimizing microgrid and virtual power plant operations, reducing energy costs, and improving efficiency.

The future of intelligent energy management is here.
