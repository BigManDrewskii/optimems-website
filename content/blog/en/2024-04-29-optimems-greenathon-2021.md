The innovative OptiMEMS software framework from the Information Technology Institute (ITI) of the Centre for Research and Technology – Hellas (CERTH) won the **second prize** — among more than 100 submitted proposals — in the panhellenic competition for green innovation **"Greenathon"**.

This recognition highlights the potential of our intelligent energy management solution to transform how we power our homes, businesses, and cities.

## About Greenathon

The competition was organized by the Secretariat for Natural Environment and Water of the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the Organization for Natural Environment and Climate Change.

**Greenathon** is a panhellenic competition for green innovation, bringing together the brightest minds to tackle environmental challenges through technology.

## The OptiMEMS Framework

The OptiMEMS framework is the brain for the building blocks of the future Smart Grid.

The congested electrical distribution network now requires smart solutions to increase the rate of integration of renewable energy sources.

### What Are Microgrids?

Microgrids are fully controlled, autonomous entities that generate, store and consume electricity either interconnected or not from the main distribution grid.

A team of CERTH/ITI engineers developed the OptiMEMS framework as a holistic automatic controller for the new generation microgrids.

It is a complete solution for the optimal energy management of a microgrid, including:

### Energy Assets

- Production and storage units
- Electric vehicles
- Controllable smart loads

---

## Key Features

The framework is complemented by a fully customizable per-application web-based user-friendly interface through which users can visualize every technical and economic aspect of the microgrid operation.

### Technology Integration

The developed framework integrates seamlessly different heterogeneous technologies to deliver optimal performance:

**Artificial Intelligence**
- Optimisation techniques
- Machine learning and deep learning

**Connectivity**
- Open protocols (OpenADR, OCPP)
- Distributed meters and sensors (IoT)

**User Experience**
- Visual analytics
- Custom hardware devices

## Real-World Validation

For three years, OptiMEMS has proved its highly profitable and environmentally-friendly performance through its application on the **first interconnected microgrid in Greece** — the ITI SmartHome, located in the CERTH premises.

### Piloted Deployments

At the same time, OptiMEMS has been piloted in:

- Larger industrial building installations
- Smart City level deployments
- V1G / V2G e-mobility infrastructure

This makes it a horizontal solution to the challenges of Smart Networks 2.0.

## What This Means

The Greenathon recognition validates our approach to intelligent energy management.

Our solution isn't just theoretical — it's been tested and proven in real-world applications.

From single homes to entire smart cities, OptiMEMS delivers measurable results in energy optimization and cost reduction.
