## 2. The Problem Section

### Headline
**The Modern Energy Landscape Is Too Complex to Manage Manually**

### Opening Statement
Distributed energy systems are becoming more diverse and more dynamic. Renewables output fluctuates by the minute. Batteries must be charged and discharged at the right time with the right amount of energy to achieve maximum profit.

### The Challenge
EV chargers and heat pumps create unpredictable demand spikes. And when energy assets multiply across sites, portfolios, or whole communities, the complexity grows exponentially.

### Real-World Example Context
- **Typical house consumption:** 10kWh
- **EV battery capacity:** up to 60kWh (requiring real-time adaptations)
- **Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capability:** Taking energy from the car and providing it to the house when energy is cheaper during periods the vehicle isn't in use

### Key Pain Points
- **Fragmented systems** with limited interoperability
- **No unified visibility** across production, consumption, storage, and loads
- **Reactive corrections** instead of proactive planning
- **Suboptimal asset scheduling** leading to wasted energy and higher costs
- **Difficulty participating** in flexibility markets or VPP operations
- **Regulations and new technologies** evolving faster than existing tools

### The Bottom Line
Without a unified intelligence layer, energy assets remain under-utilized, poorly coordinated, and operated below their full economic potential.

### Visual Requirements
- Infographic showing complexity of managing multiple energy assets
- Visual representation of energy flows and demand spikes
- Professional, technical aesthetic

## 4. How It Works Section

### Headline
**Three Steps to Intelligent Energy Management**

### Subheadline
Hardware + Software Solution

### Step 1: Monitor
**Collect real-time data from all assets**

Collects real-time data from all assets—generation, consumption, storage, controllable loads, and grid interconnection.

### Step 2: Forecast
**Predict energy behavior and market conditions**

Uses in-house AI algorithms to predict energy behavior and market conditions.

### Step 3: Optimize & Execute
**Automatically execute the perfect schedule**

Our system automatically calculates and executes the perfect asset schedule, making instant, optimal decisions including:

- **Charging/Discharging** at peak profitability
- **Consumption** from the cheapest source available
- **Revenue maximization** by selling to the grid at the right time and exploiting ancillary service markets

### Result Statement
The result is flawless execution, 24/7, requiring absolutely no human intervention or user input.

### Visual Requirements
- Hardware images (if available)
- Platform dashboard screenshots
- Hardware photo showing industrial controller with green terminal connector
- Step-by-step process visualization
